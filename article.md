#Airline Industry Using AIOps Platform

In today's fast-paced airline industry, managing IT infrastructure and cloud services effectively is paramount to ensuring seamless operations and passenger satisfaction.
An Artificial Intelligence for IT Operations (AIOps) platform tailored for airlines transforms traditional IT operations by harnessing the power of AI/ML to automate key
functions like event correlation, incident management, auto-ticketing, auto-notification, auto-remediation and application performance monitoring. By correlating events across diverse streams,
AIOPS quickly identifies root causes, reducing downtime and enabling faster incident response. Automated ticketing and resolution capabilities further relieve IT staff from routine tasks,
especially in integrating legacy systems and meeting aviation-specific regulatory standards. Despite these hurdles, AIOps is a forward-looking solution that drives operational efficiency,
minimizes disruptions, and ultimately elevates the airline's ability to handle complex IT landscapes with agility and precision.

Challenges:
Managing complex, large-scale across operations areas emaples, reservation, flight operations, groun services, weight and balance, baggage, mobile applications
